    <subject>Discovering the mobile phone password</subject>

Hey #PLAYERNAME#. Before starting, I just wanted to make some challenges for you.
I'll leave the IP for you to connect and discover an exploit and have it converted to hexadecimal. Please send it to me.
The exploit is a binary code that contains the mobile phone password.

Thanks,

- TSK

PS: I recommend that you point into a notepad without spaces and convert it from binary to hexadecimal.
